A simple browser built with Electron.

# Why?

Idk, I could, so I did.

# How to use

### Run Locally (Development)
To start the app in development mode with hot-reloading:
```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

### Build for Production
To build the installer for your OS (Windows .exe, Mac .dmg):

The output will be in the `release/` directory.
